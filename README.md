  # Description

  This project was meant to demonstrate the potential of MongoDB, a database framework separate from the widely-used SQL framework. This project demonstrates the utility and flexibility of MongoDB, being able to nest documents within themselves for ease of access and readibility by human eyes.

  ## Usage

  Use Insomnia to connect to your localhost, then make HTTPS requests.
